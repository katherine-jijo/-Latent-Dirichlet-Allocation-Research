# Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-Research

# Medical Corpus Topic Modeling


## Introduction

*This research is in partnership with Northwell Health. It invites engagement in the exploration of unstructured medical data, intending to reveal latent patterns and unveil critical insights that promise to enrich our understanding of healthcare communication.

Welcome to the Medical Corpus Topic Modeling project, an exploratory endeavor at the intersection of healthcare informatics and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This initiative is dedicated to the systematic examination and deciphering of complex, unstructured medical data to unveil latent patterns and significant insights.

At its core, this project harnesses the power of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) as a vehicle for hidden themes within extensive collections of medical texts. Augmented by the integration of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) APIs. The primary objective is to discern latent topics within medical corpora (ex: nurses notes), discern underlying themes, and discern the intricate associations among medical terminologies.

In the context of healthcare's vast and unstructured textual landscape, the pursuit of revealing latent patterns assumes paramount importance. This endeavor seeks not only to analyze but also to comprehend and illuminate the intricate web of medical terminologies, thereby enhancing our understanding of the complexity inherent in medical discourse.

Through methodical data preprocessing, robust model training, and comprehensive analysis pipelines, this research aims to reveal the subtle nuances embedded within medical narratives. Visual representations, findings, and detailed analyses serve as conduits for unraveling obscured patterns and illuminating previously obscured facets of healthcare narratives.




## Features
