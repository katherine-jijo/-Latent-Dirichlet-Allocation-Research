# Medical Corpus Topic Modeling

Performing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on a medical corpus to identify and analyze the most occurring terms.

## Introduction

This project utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover topics within a medical corpus. The goal is to identify the most occurring terms and provide insights into the underlying themes present in the corpus.

## Features

- LDA Topic Modeling 
- Term Topic Matrix and Document Topic Matrix
- Customizable Parameters

- **Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):** Includes Jupyter notebooks and scripts demonstrating LDA implementation to identify latent topics within textual data, yielding a Term Topic Matrix and Document Topic Matrix
- **MeSH and SNOMED Integration:** Python code integrates MeSH and SNOMED APIs for retrieving medical descriptors related to terms used in the corpus.
- **Data Processing and Analysis:** Encompasses data preprocessing, model training, and analysis pipelines tailored for medical term analysis and topic modeling.
- **Findings and Results:** Presents visualizations, insights, and findings obtained from analyzing medical texts and LDA topic modeling outputs.

## Requirements

- Python 
- Libraries: scikit-learn, matplotlib, wordcloud
